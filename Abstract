We have seen that the inception of Internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields. Internet has made life of people so easy that people today have access to any information they want sitting at their home. One of the main fields that Internet has revolutionized is communication. And talking about communication over Internet, the first thing that comes in our mind is E-mail. E-mails are considered to be the most reliable way of communication over Internet, for sending or receiving some important information. But there is a special criteria for humans to access the Internet and the criteria is you must be able to see. You must be thinking that what sort of criteria is this, everyone with eyes can see. But there are also specially able people in our society who are not gifted with what you have. Yes there are some visually challenged people or blind people who cannot see things and thus cannot see the computer screen or keyboard.
A survey shows that there are more than 250 million visually challenged people around the globe. That is, around 250 million people are unaware of how to use Internet or E-mail. The only way by which a visually impaired person can send an E-mail is, they have to dictate the entire content of the mail to a third person( not visually challenged ) and then the third person will compose the mail and send on the behalf of the visually impaired person.
But this is not a correct way to deal with this problem. It is very less likely that every time a visually challenged person can find someone for help. Although for these reasons the specially able people are criticized by our society.
So, for the betterment of society and giving an equal status to such specially able people we have come up with this project idea which provides the user with ability to send mails using voice commands without the need of keyboard or any other visual things.
